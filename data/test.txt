[00:01.000] 作词 : Michael Jackson/Lionel Richie
[00:14.149]There is a time when we should heed a certain call
[00:20.579]Cause the world it seems it’s right in this line
[00:27.420]Cause there’s a chance for taking in needing our own lives
[00:34.300]It seems we need nothing at all
[00:41.309]I used to feel that I should give away my heart
[00:48.149]And it shows that fear of needing them
[00:55.499]Then I read the headlines and it said they’re dying there
[01:02.499]And it shows that we must heed instead
[01:08.440]We are the world
[01:11.800]We are the children
[01:15.169]We are the ones who make a brighter day
[01:18.380]So let’s start giving

[01:40.560]Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
[01:46.840]Cause you know that they can feed them all
[01:54.399]Then I read the paper and it said that you’ve been dying
[02:00.710]And it shows the second we will call
[02:07.149]We are the world
[02:10.559]We are the children
[02:13.919]We are the ones who make a brighter day
[02:17.899]So let’s start giving

[02:35.319]No there’s a time when we must love them all
[02:42.420]And it seems that life, it don’t make love at all
[02:48.889]But if you’d be there, and I’ll love you more and more
[02:56.990]It seems in life,I didn’t do that

[00:12.740]I used to rule the world
[00:16.480]Seas would rise when I gave the word
[00:19.120]Now in the morning I sleep alone
[00:23.240]Sweep the streets I used to own
[00:27.490]
[00:40.670]I used to roll the dice
[00:44.200]Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
[00:47.430]Listen as the crowd would sing:
[00:51.240]"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"
[00:54.450]One minute I held the key
[00:58.070]Next the walls were closed on me
[01:01.160]And I discovered that my castles stand
[01:05.060]Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
[01:08.090]
[01:08.940]I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
[01:12.550]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[01:16.130]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[01:19.550]My missionaries in a foreign field
[01:23.100]For some reason I can not explain
[01:26.500]Once you go there was never, never an honest word
[01:32.960]That was when I ruled the world
[01:38.590]
[01:49.879]It was the wicked and wild wind
[01:54.066]Blew down the doors to let me in.
[01:56.477]Shattered windows and the sound of drums
[02:00.426]People could not believe what I'd become
[02:02.325]Revolutionaries Wait
[02:07.268]For my head on a silver plate
[02:10.437]Just a puppet on a lonely string
[02:14.475]Oh who would ever want to be king?
[02:17.066]
[02:18.476]I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
[02:21.866]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[02:25.385]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[02:28.866]My missionaries in a foreign field
[02:33.497]For some reason I can not explain
[02:36.116]I know Saint Peter won't call my name
[02:39.016]Never an honest word
[02:41.866]But that was when I ruled the world
[02:46.467]
[02:58.857](Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
[03:14.835]Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
[03:17.854]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
[03:21.286]Be my mirror my sword and shield
[03:24.644]My missionaries in a foreign field
[03:28.214]For some reason I can not explain
[03:31.634]I know Saint Peter won't call my name
[03:35.134]Never an honest word
[03:38.074]But that was when I ruled the world
